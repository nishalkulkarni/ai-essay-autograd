6050,"The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting.

Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world.

Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope.

I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried.

7197,"There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope.

The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.",3.0,252,10,4.384920634920635,129,0.003968253968253968,0.26587301587301587,0.07539682539682539,0.19444444444444445,0.01984126984126984,0.154,0.08,0.766,0.08933934271663516

As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head.

His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist.

Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion.

A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake.

7624,"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog.
